诸位在学校时、医院里是否有遇到类似情境呢？这就是遇到了Gunner, 指争强好胜的医学生。每个医学院班级里都会有一个“枪手”，甚至更多。他们像拼命三郎一样学习，对GPA相当在意，很少和他人分享学习成果，还时不时干些不厚道的事，譬如抢答提问别人的问题，在老师面前评论他人，Show出自己。情节恶劣者甚至还会学术造假，这属于极端情况了。

作为医学生，你几乎肯定会遇到Gunner。（别说没有，没有的话Gunner很可能就是你！）怎么办呢？如果Gunner让你感到不悦，甚至影响你的正常学习，“惹不起躲得起”不失为一个法子，小组学习时千万别和这样的人呆一块。虽说是同学，但也没义务非和他一起学习不可。另一办法就是自己做出表率，带头和同学分享学习资源，让Gunner意识到自己的不足。如果真的有人宁顽不灵，把课堂当做个人秀，占用大家时间，那就直接找他说去，注意礼貌和诚意很重要，毕竟同窗嘛。最后，如果发现Gunner有做出类似学术造假的违反原则之事，检举揭发之。

不幸的是，随着医学院的竞争日益激烈，Gunner越来越多，医学生之间有恶性竞争之势。偶们该如何求生存？一言以蔽之：把自己的事做到再完美也不足为过。做好自己，把Gunner当做消遣即可。要知道老师也曾是学生，也曾遇到过Gunner，没准比你还反感他们呢~

**How Should I Deal With Gunners?**

# <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Sara Cohen, MD</span>

During one of the first anatomy labs in medical school, I was approached by the professor. After he examined our dissection of the abdominal cavity, he reached his gloved hand deep into the cadaver and spoke to me for the very first time as he pointed at a blood vessel. &#8220;Sara,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can you tell me the name of this artery?&#8221;

I was pleased because I knew this one. I opened my mouth to answer the question, but before I could get a word out, my lab partner piped up, &#8220;The gastroepiploic artery.&#8221;

I was shocked. The professor had clearly addressed the question to me. He used my name and he was looking right at me. There was no way that could have been misunderstood. Why would my lab partner yell out the answer to a question that was obviously not directed at her before I even had a chance to speak up?

It turned out that this was my first experience with a &#8220;gunner.&#8221;

The definition of &#8220;gunner&#8221; varies depending on who you talk to, but it generally refers to an especially competitive medical student. Every medical school class has at least 1 gunner, and usually many more than that. Some people use the term to refer to students who study much more than average and are especially concerned with grades. However, the term may also be used to refer to medical students who exhibit behavior that is either borderline unethical or even blatant cheating.

Gunner behavior in the preclinical years that is borderline unethical includes (to name a few) hoarding study materials, making comments in front of professors that are meant to make the gunner look smarter and other classmates look unprepared, and dominating small group discussions. More malignant gunner behavior includes ripping pages out of textbooks in the library, sending out erroneous study materials to the class, or even cheating on examinations.

As a medical student, you will almost certainly encounter a gunner classmate at some point. (If you don&#8217;t, the gunner might be you!) Many specialties have become very competitive, which puts pressure on students who want to match in these specialties to be at the top of the class. If a gunner is making you feel unprepared or making it difficult for you to learn, the easiest approach is to avoid him or her in an academic setting. If you have a study group, make sure it only includes classmates who are conducive to your learning, rather than people who are trying to top you or make you feel insecure. Just because a classmate is your friend, that doesn&#8217;t obligate you to study with that person as well.

Another strategy is to set a good example. If you share your study materials with the class, it will encourage others to do the same. This is a subtle way to let gunners know that information should not be hoarded, and it is best for everyone to learn the material.

If a gunner is making class very unpleasant by dominating the lecturers&#8217; time, and the subtle hints aren&#8217;t working, the only option might be to approach him or her and explain your concerns. Most students don&#8217;t want to be perceived as gunners, so pointing this out to the student might make him or her change. When you speak to your classmate, be nice and respectful when you address this issue &#8212; after all, this is someone you&#8217;re going to be working with for the next several years and you don&#8217;t want to make an enemy.

Finally, if the gunner is outright cheating, it is your responsibility to report this to the appropriate authorities.

Unfortunately, during the clinical years, gunner behavior often escalates, because grades are largely based on evaluations from the attending physicians who are observing you. A gunner may try to be the first person at work every day and the last to leave. He or she may try to leap in and do every available procedure or surgery, even on a patient who belongs to another student. I&#8217;ve heard of students who looked up the laboratory results on their co-student&#8217;s patients to be ready if the other student dropped the ball.

The best thing you can do in that situation is try to ignore the gunner&#8217;s behavior and do the best job you can on your own patients. If you are very diligent and knowledgeable, that will be apparent to your attendings and residents. However, if the gunner&#8217;s behavior is very disruptive, the best recourse may be to confront him or her.

Keep in mind that all attendings and residents were once medical students, and they&#8217;re often able to recognize gunner behavior. Although the gunner may impress some attendings, others will be turned off by attempts at showing off. You may be gratified to discover that your attending dislikes your gunner co-student as much as you do.

Although gunners are a common occurrence in medical school, there&#8217;s no reason for them to make your life miserable unless you let them. Work hard and learn as much as you can and take gunners for what they are: harmless distractions.
